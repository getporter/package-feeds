# Porter Package Feeds

This repository atom feeds for official Porter mixins and plugins.
These feeds are used to install the latest version of an official mixin:

For example, `porter mixins install NAME` by default looks for the mixin in these official feeds, unless you specify --url or --feed-url.

The canonical location to these feeds are:

* https://cdn.porter.sh/mixins/atom.xml
* https://cdn.porter.sh/plugins/atom.xml
